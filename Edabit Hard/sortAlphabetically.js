/*
Sort Authors Last Names Alphabetically
Today you volunteered as a librarian. You were given an array of objects, each one containing different book information. You need to sort the objects in alphabetical order of the author's last name.

Examples
sortByLastName([
  { name: "Harry Potter", rating: "8+", author: "Joanne Rowling" },
  { name: "Warcross", rating: "13+", author: "Marie Lu" },
  { name: "The Hunger Games", rating: "12+", author: "Suzanne Collins" },
]) âžž [
  { name: "The Hunger Games", rating: "12+", author: "Suzanne Collins" },
  { name: "Warcross", rating: "13+", author: "Marie Lu" },
  { name: "Harry Potter", rating: "8+", author: "Joanne Rowling" },
]
Notes
There will always be a name, rating, and author property on each object.
The array will never be empty.
The author property will always feature only a first and last name.
